**Sample Phrases**

"Alexa.., ask Davis what's up?"

* , ask Davis what is up today?
* , ask Davis what happened today?
* , ask Davis what happened last week?

Davis is forgiving, and you don't have to repeat the above phrases verbatim. Make sure you hit your key words like, "what's up", and "yesterday", and Davis will take care of the rest.

Once a session is started with Davis, you don't have to repeat the "Alexa" start command. If the blue ring light is off, then use "Alexa" to re-open a session.

Davis stores each conversation that you have. So if you are sidetracked you can pick up where you left off.

Davis will ask you questions during your exchange and guide you to an important problem within your application. Act natural, and respond as if you were talking to a friend. Davis will translate your intent into action and provide you with the answers you are seeking.

Your intention can be "Yes", but feel free to use "Sure", "absolutely", "yeah", or any other confirmation word. If your confirmation word or phrase doesn't work, please email davis@dynatrace.com and we will add it.

Other phrases to help you get started:

* What happened yesterday around 9am?
* What happened yesterday morning?
* What happened yesterday afternoon?
* What happened around 11am this morning?
* Did anything happen around 2pm yesterday?
* Tell me about problems that happened yesterday

Davis is starting to learn more and develop differentiated ways of telling you about APM problems. Davis has a couple built in intents that have a default time range and filter applied. For example,
if you ask, *"Are there any capacity issues?"*, then Davis will only look at infrastructure related problems and report back the top 3 of concern.


Davis is starting to have conversations that extend beyond problems and into user analytics. For example, ask Davis *"Can you tell me about user activity levels?"* and Davis will respond with a 24 hour absolute and relative summary of user activity. You can also ask about user activity levels for a specific application? For example, ask Davis *Can you tell me about user activity levels for easyTravel?*

We're always adding new interactions to Davis and you're welcome to add your own!
