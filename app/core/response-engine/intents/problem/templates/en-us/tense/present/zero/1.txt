if (entity name contains SYNTHETIC_TEST)

then

Synthetic Monitoring detected a $eventType for $entityName. This problem is currently $status. I would suggest viewing the web check dashlet in Dynatrace for further information. Would you like me to take you there?

if (eventType = FAILURE_RATE_INCREASE)

then

Due to an $eventType, there is an open $impactLevel problem for your $entityName.

The $entityName is currently experiencing a $eventType. #Would you like to know more? #Want me to show you this?

The failure rate increased for the $entityName. This problem is currently $status. #Would you like to know more? #Ping me if you want to know more.

if (eventType = SYNTHETIC_SLOWDOWN) then 

Dynatrace detected there is a decrease in your synthectic monitoring tests for $entityName application. I would suggest viewng this in your web-check dashlet. #Do you want me to take you there?

#what is PGI?

The $entityName is experiencing a $eventType event. This problem is currently $status. #Would you like to know more? 

if (time_diff of $endTime-$startTime > 1 min)

then 

This $impactLevel problem was open for more than a minute and it was effecting the $entityName. #Would you like to know more. #Say show me and I'll take you there.

If ($eventType = USER_ACTION_DURATION_DEGRADATION) then

User actions are currently degraded for $entityName. This problem has been open for $now - $startTime. #Would you like to see this in Dynatrace? #Would you like to know more?

if (eventType = PROCESS_LOG_ERROR)

then

The $entityName has a $eventType.


if ($eventType = UNEXPECTED_LOW_LOAD)

then

At that time there did not seem like there was enough load on $entityName. This problem is still open. #Would you like to know more? #Want me to show you?

At that time there was unusual low load on $entityName and this issue is currently still open. #Would you like to know more? #Want me to show you?

Conversion rates might have dipped in that time frame as there was unexpected low load on $entityName.

During that timeframe, there was a decrease in load for $entityName. Did you accidentally trip on the firewall? This problem is still open. Would you like to know more?
