Welcome to Davis!  Davis provides several new, cutting edge mediums for interacting with Dynatrace.  Currently integration with Slack and Amazon Alexa are officially supported but more could be added in the future.

We've tried to make the process of setting up and configuring Davis as simple as possible.  However, feel free to open an issue or <a href="mailto:davis@dynatrace.com">email</a> if any questions or feedback.  Now, without further ado, let's get started!
